    " Every function needs a definition. Think of it like a normal dictionary. If you were to go look up a certain word you would need to know the first few letters to find it. But there also would only be one possible definition for that word in the dictionary. Python functions are the same in this regard, they need a unique name so that you can find it later.\n",

For parameters you \"pass\" these ingredients and then tell the function what to do with them and hopefully [crossesfingers] we get cake.\n",

In this case we're interested only in movies that fall in the Action genre. So we measure out all the action movies from our dataset and then what? Can you see what happens next?\n",
